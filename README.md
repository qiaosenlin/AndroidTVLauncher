### Summary
This is the TV Launcher I modified with Skyworth Software team in 2020. It is developed in Java using Android TV. We modified the UI content and FocusView from the original Google Leanback Library. Added some movie and media information by third party application. Also Added support for specific control needs for TV users.

### Features
> * Leanback style
> * Pictures show
> * Video broadcast (jiecao player - based on ijkplayer)
> * Details of the media
> * The third party application list
> * Desktop special function
